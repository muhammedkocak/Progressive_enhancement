        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p class="firstp">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe</q></strong>. The next day the horse came back bring seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe</q></strong>.</p> 

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe</q></strong>. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe</q></strong>.</p>

        <blockquote> "The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune."</blockquote>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
